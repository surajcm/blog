At its core, Java 11 delivers robust security features, refined garbage collection mechanisms, and performance optimizations that collectively elevate the resilience and efficiency of Java applications.

Security lies at the heart of Java 11's advancements, with a comprehensive suite of features designed to fortify applications against emerging threats and vulnerabilities. From enhanced TLS support to improved cryptographic algorithms, Java 11 provides developers with the tools they need to build secure, resilient applications in an increasingly hostile digital environment.

Moreover, Java 11 introduces updates to the garbage collection (GC) algorithms, resulting in more efficient memory management and reduced latency. These GC enhancements not only enhance application performance but also contribute to a smoother and more predictable user experience, particularly for high-throughput, low-latency applications.

In addition to security and performance improvements, Java 11 offers a host of productivity enhancements and language features that streamline development workflows and empower developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code. By migrating to Java 11, organizations can future-proof their applications, benefitting from a modern, stable platform that fosters innovation and agility.

In this blog post, we'll explore the compelling reasons to upgrade to Java 11, providing actionable insights and practical guidance for a seamless migration experience. Join us as we unlock the power of Java 11 and embark on a journey towards building more secure, stable, and resilient Java applications.

## Understanding the Java 11 Release
Java 11, released in September 2018, introduced several important features and improvements. It was the first long-term support (LTS) release after Java 8. Key additions included the new HTTP Client API, which supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket, making asynchronous programming easier. The release also introduced Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters, enhancing code readability. Nest-Based Access Control was added to improve the performance of nested classes. Java 11 removed several deprecated modules and APIs, including Java EE and CORBA, to streamline the platform. It also introduced the ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) for low-latency garbage collection and added support for TLS 1.3. Additionally, Java 11 brought improvements to the Java launcher, allowing it to run single-file source code programs directly, and introduced new string methods like isBlank(), strip(), and lines().

The Long-Term Support (LTS) model in Java is a release strategy that provides extended support and stability for specific Java versions. LTS releases, such as Java 8, 11, and 17, receive updates, bug fixes, and security patches for an extended period, typically around 8 years. This model is significant for migration because it allows organizations to plan their upgrade cycles more effectively, reducing the frequency of major version transitions. LTS versions provide a stable platform for long-term application development and maintenance, ensuring compatibility and security for an extended period. This is particularly important for enterprises with large-scale Java applications, as it minimizes the risks and costs associated with frequent upgrades. Non-LTS releases, which occur more frequently, offer new features but have shorter support windows, making them less suitable for production environments that require long-term stability. The LTS model thus strikes a balance between innovation and stability, allowing businesses to choose between staying current with the latest features or maintaining a stable, well-supported environment.

## Assessment of Current Java 8 Codebase

Migrating from Java 8 to Java 11 involves more than just updating the JDK, it requires a comprehensive assessment of your current codebase to identify potential challenges. Here's a technical checklist to guide you through the evaluation:

1. **Inventory of Dependencies and Libraries**:
   - **Third-Party Libraries**: Create a detailed list of all external libraries and frameworks your application relies on. Pay special attention to:
     - **Apache Commons**, **Google Guava**, **Jackson**, etc. Ensure these libraries are updated to versions compatible with Java 11.
     - **Frameworks** like **Spring** or **Hibernate** should be upgraded to versions that support Java 11 (e.g., Spring 5.x+).
   - **Obsolete Libraries**: Identify any libraries that are no longer maintained or have been superseded. Examples include:
     - **Joda-Time**: Consider replacing it with Java 8's built-in `java.time` API.
     - **XML Processing Libraries**: Update or replace libraries if they depend on removed Java EE modules.

2. **Use of Removed or Deprecated APIs**:
   - **Java EE and CORBA Modules**: Java 11 has removed several modules that were deprecated in earlier versions:
     - `java.xml.ws` (JAX-WS, for SOAP web services)
     - `java.xml.bind` (JAXB, for XML binding)
     - `java.activation` (JAF)
     - `java.corba`
     - If your application uses these, you'll need to add them as external dependencies. They are available as standalone modules on Maven Central.
   - **Internal APIs**:
     - Check for usage of internal JDK APIs (e.g., `sun.misc.Unsafe` or `com.sun.*` classes). These are not guaranteed to be present in newer JDKs.
     - Use tools like [jdeps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jdeps.htm) to analyze dependencies on JDK internal APIs.

3. **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**:
   - **Modularity**: Although not mandatory, understand how the module system introduced in Java 9 affects your application.
   - **Automatic Modules**: Libraries not yet modularized become automatic modules. Verify that this doesn't introduce conflicts.
   - **Split Packages**: Ensure no two modules export the same package, which can cause `LinkageError`.

4. **Language Feature Changes**:
   - **Lambda Expressions and Streams**: While largely compatible, ensure that any APIs used havenâ€™t changed behavior.
   - **Default Methods in Interfaces**: Be aware of any new default methods that might conflict with your implementations.

5. **Garbage Collector Changes**:
   - **Removed Garbage Collectors**: The **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)** collector is deprecated in Java 9. If your application specifies CMS, consider moving to **G1GC** or **ZGC**.
   - **Default GC Changes**: Java 9 onward uses **G1GC** as the default collector. Test your application for performance under the new GC.

6. **Command-Line Argument Changes**:
   - **Obsolete JVM Flags**: Some JVM flags used in Java 8 may no longer be valid. For example, the `-XX:PermSize` and `-XX:MaxPermSize` options are obsolete due to the removal of the Permanent Generation.
   - Use the `java --help` command or consult the [JDK migration guides](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/11/migrate/) for updated options.

7. **Bytecode and Classfile Version**:
   - **Classfile Version**: Java 11 uses a newer classfile version (`55.0`). Ensure that tools or libraries that manipulate bytecode (like **ASM**, **Javassist**, or **ByteBuddy**) are updated to versions that support Java 11 bytecode.
   - **Annotation Processing and Compilation**: Update any custom annotation processors and check for compatibility with the new compiler.

8. **Reflection and Illegal Access**:
   - **Strong Encapsulation**: Java 9 and above enforce stronger encapsulation of internal APIs.
     - Illegal reflective access operations will result in warnings and may become errors in future releases.
     - Use `--add-exports` and `--add-opens` options as temporary measures but plan to refactor code to eliminate these accesses.

9. **Serialization Compatibility**:
   - **Serializable Classes**: Verify that serialization of objects remains compatible, especially if using custom serialization or `serialVersionUID`.
   - **Removed Types**: Ensure serialized classes do not reference types that have been removed from the JDK.

10. **Internationalization and Localization**:
    - **Encoding Changes**: Java 11 defaults to UTF-8 for properties files. If your application relies on the default system encoding, explicitly specify it or adjust your files accordingly.

11. **Networking and Security**:
    - **TLS and SSL Protocols**: Older protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0/1.1 are disabled by default. Update your application and servers to use TLS 1.2 or higher.
    - **Algorithm Constraints**: Stronger security constraints may impact cryptographic operations. Verify that key sizes and algorithms meet the new requirements.

12. **Testing and Continuous Integration**:
    - **Unit and Integration Tests**: Run all tests with Java 11 to catch runtime and compatibility issues.
    - **Test Frameworks**: Ensure frameworks like **JUnit**, **Mockito**, and **Selenium** are updated to versions compatible with Java 11.
    - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Update build agents and Docker containers to use Java 11.

13. **Build Tools and Plugins**:
    - **Maven**:
      - Upgrade to Maven 3.6.0 or higher.
      - Update the **maven-compiler-plugin** to version 3.8.0+ and set the `release` option to `11`.

    - **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, **NetBeans**:
      - Update your IDE to a version that fully supports Java 11 features and syntax.
      - Check that all plugins and extensions are compatible with both the IDE version and Java 11.

15. **Logging Frameworks**:
    - **Log4j**, **SLF4J**, **Logback**:
      - Update logging frameworks to versions compatible with Java 11.
      - Verify custom appenders or loggers for compatibility.

16. **Application Servers and Containers**:
    - If deploying to an application server (e.g., **Tomcat**, **Jetty**, **WildFly**), ensure it supports Java 11.
    - Update any container configurations or Dockerfiles to use Java 11 base images.

17. **Performance Testing**:
    - **Profiling and Monitoring Tools**:
      - Update tools like **VisualVM**, **YourKit**, or **JProfiler** to versions that support Java 11.
    - **Benchmarking**:
      - Conduct performance regression tests to identify any performance degradations introduced by the migration.

18. **Documentation and API Changes**:
    - **Java API Updates**:
      - Review changes in the Java Standard Library between Java 8 and Java 11. Notable updates include new methods in classes like `String`, `Collections`, and `Optional`.
    - **Deprecation of Nashorn JavaScript Engine**:
      - If your application uses the Nashorn engine (`jdk.nashorn.api.scripting`), consider migrating to an alternative like GraalVM's JavaScript engine.

By systematically examining these technical aspects of your Java 8 codebase, you can uncover potential migration hurdles. This proactive approach allows you to develop strategies for:

- **Code Refactoring**: Modifying or rewriting code that relies on outdated or removed features.

   Java 11 introduces several new features that can simplify code and enhance functionality. Refactoring your code to use these features can make it more concise and expressive.

   - **Local Variable Type Inference with `var`**:
     - **Simplify Variable Declarations**: Use `var` to allow the compiler to infer the variable type from the context.
       ```java
       // Before Java 11
       Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

       // With Java 11
       var wordCounts = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
       ```
     - **Best Practices**:
       - Use `var` when the variable type is clear from the context.
       - Avoid overusing `var` when it hinders code readability.

   - **String Class Enhancements**:
     - **`isBlank()`**: Checks if a string is empty or contains only whitespace.
       ```java
       if (input.isBlank()) {
           // Handle blank input
       }
       ```
     - **`strip()`, `stripLeading()`, `stripTrailing()`**: Unicode-aware whitespace removal.
       ```java
       String trimmed = input.strip();
       ```
     - **`lines()`**: Splits a string into a stream of lines.
       ```java
       input.lines().forEach(System.out::println);
       ```
     - **`repeat(int count)`**: Repeats the string a specified number of times.
       ```java
       String separator = "-".repeat(10);
       ```

   - **New Collection Factory Methods** (from Java 9 onward):
     - Create immutable collections more concisely.
       ```java
       var list = List.of("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");
       var set = Set.of("Red", "Green", "Blue");
       var map = Map.of("USA", "Washington", "Canada", "Ottawa");
       ```

   - **Enhancements to Optional Class**:
     - **`isEmpty()`**: Checks if an `Optional` is empty.
       ```java
       if (optionalValue.isEmpty()) {
           // Handle absence of value
       }
       ```
     - **`orElseThrow()` (no argument)**: Throws `NoSuchElementException` if the value is not present.
       ```java
       String value = optionalValue.orElseThrow();
       ```

   - **Improved Lambda Parameter Type Inference**:
     - Java 11 allows the use of `var` in lambda expressions.
       ```java
       // Before Java 11
       (String s) -> s.length()

       // With Java 11
       (var s) -> s.length()
       ```
     - Useful for adding annotations to lambda parameters.

   - **HTTP Client API (`java.net.http`)**:
     - Replace third-party HTTP clients with the built-in, modern HTTP client.
       ```java
       var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
       var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                                .uri(URI.create("https://api.example.com/data"))
                                .build();
       var response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
       System.out.println(response.body());
       ```

   - **Stream API Enhancements**:
     - **`takeWhile()` and `dropWhile()`**: Operate on streams based on a condition.
       ```java
       List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 2, 1);
       List<Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                                     .takeWhile(n -> n < 3)
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
       // result: [1, 2]
       ```

       // Alternative
       Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
           // Code to run on shutdown
       }));
       ```

   - **Use New File Methods from `java.nio.file`**:
     - Switch from legacy `File` I/O to NIO for better error handling and performance.
       ```java
       // Before Java 11
       File file = new File("path/to/file");
       BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

       // With Java 11
       Path path = Paths.get("path/to/file");
       var lines = Files.readAllLines(path);
       ```

   - **Adhere to Updated Coding Conventions**:
     - **Naming Conventions**: Follow standard naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.

       ```java
       // Before Java 11
       BufferedReader reader = null;
       try {
           reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
           // Read file
       } finally {
           if (reader != null) {
               reader.close();
           }
       }

       // With Java 11
       try (var reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
           // Read file
       }
       ```

   - **Enhance Null Handling**:
     - Use `Optional` to represent nullable values, reducing the risk of `NullPointerException`.
       ```java
       // Before Java 11
       if (object != null) {
           object.doSomething();
       }

       // With Java 11
       Optional.ofNullable(object).ifPresent(Object::doSomething);
       ```

   - **Leverage Modularization** (Optional but Recommended):
     - Introduce modules to your application for better encapsulation and maintainability.
       ```java
       // module-info.java
       module com.example.myapp {
           requires java.base;
           exports com.example.myapp.services;
       }
       ```

   By modernizing your code, you ensure that it aligns with current best practices, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

Deploying Java 11 applications involves updating your deployment infrastructure, ensuring compatibility, and adjusting configurations to align with the new Java version.

- **Update Deployment Infrastructure**:
  
  - **Java Runtime Environment**:
    - **Unified JDK**: Java 11 no longer provides a separate JRE distribution. Instead, you need to deploy the full JDK or create a custom runtime image.
    - **Use OpenJDK Builds**: Choose from OpenJDK distributions such as **Adoptium Temurin**, **Azul Zulu**, **Amazon Corretto**, or **Oracle's OpenJDK**.
  
  - **Containerization**:
    - **Update Docker Images**: Use official Java 11 Docker images to ensure consistency.
      ```dockerfile
      FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
      COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
      CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/myapp.jar"]
      ```
    - **Custom Runtime Images with `jlink`**:
      - Create a minimized Java runtime containing only the modules your application needs, reducing the deployment size and surface area.
      - Example:
        ```bash
        jlink --module-path $JAVA_HOME/jmods --add-modules java.base,java.sql --output custom-runtime
        ```
