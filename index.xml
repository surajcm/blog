I live in a beautiful coastal city named Kochi in south India.
I work as a technical architect in ibs software, where I continue to spend 15+ years of my career. I am lucky to work with a few amazing individuals who share the same passion, and I love to call them my team.
During my work, I often come across a lot of things that feel like it might be really useful for everyone.</description></item></channel></rss>
