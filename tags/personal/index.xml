&lt;p>Hello everyone, I am a software architect from India. I live in a beautiful coastal city named &lt;strong>Kochi&lt;/strong> in south India.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I work as a technical architect in ibs software, where I continue to spend 15+ years of my career. I am lucky to work with a few amazing individuals who share the same passion, and I love to call them my team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my work, I often come across a lot of things that feel like it might be really useful for everyone. There are a lot of stuff that make fee feel like it will really benefit others. My plan for this blog is to make it a platform for sharing things, may be code, may be designs, may be something else. The plan is to write for the people who are in the same line of work, coding and designing things.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
