[{"title":"Hello world","date":"","description":"Hello world to the blogging universe.","body":"Hello everyone, I am a software architect from India. I live in a beautiful coastal city named Kochi in south India.\nI work as a technical architect in ibs software, where I continue to spend 14+ years of my career. I am lucky to work with a few amazing individuals who share the same passion, and I love to call them my team.\nDuring my work, I often come across a lot of things that feel like it might be really useful for everyone. There are a lot of stuff that make fee feel like it will really benefit others. My plan for this blog is to make it a platform for sharing things, may be code, may be designs, may be something else. The plan is to write for the people who are in the same line of work, coding and designing things.\nI have never been a good programmer during my early days of the career, I am still learning to be one. It took a while for me to get the confidence to continue in this job. Well, I dont really have any other options, back in the days, getting a job after completing the course from univeristy was a big challenge. Even though I haven\u0026rsquo;t formally did a CS degree, I wanted to be in this job, mainly for the $$ it brings. I did a one year diploma in computer applications before my engineering, which gave me some background for applying jobs in the IT field. Just like everyone else from my college, my plan was to get placed in a highly demanding IT company and set my career there. It took me some time for me to learn things and gain confidence to estimate my work.\n ","ref":"/blog/posts/hello-world/"}]
